# MP Shopping

This repository contains code to analyse activities from a Shopping dataset,
obtained from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop).
The code presented in this repository is the result of the course Programming
Methodology at the University of Granada. Therefore, some code were written from
professors of the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. 

This project generates reports from data obtained from the dataset, including
which products from the shop fits best with each client. This may be used to
recommend products in e-commerce. 

Code presented here have been tested using Google Test toolkit and Valgrind. 
To facilitate
the use of the code presented in MPShopping, a Makefile has been created and
several scripts are provided to generate Doxygen based documentation.
